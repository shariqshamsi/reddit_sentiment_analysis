lfo7khj,Everton,1efxuuf,0.8,"Everton have signed centre-back Jake O‚ÄôBrien from Olympique Lyonnais for an undisclosed fee, the Republic of Ireland international agreeing a four-year contract until the end of June 2028.

Regarded as one of Europe‚Äôs most talented young defenders, O‚ÄôBrien becomes the Blues‚Äô fifth signing of the summer following the loan return of Jack Harrison and arrivals of midfielder Tim Iroegbunam and forwards Iliman Ndiaye and Jesper Lindstr√∏m.


An international teammate of much-loved Everton captain Seamus Coleman, the 6ft 6in O‚ÄôBrien joined Lyon from Crystal Palace last August and shone in France, breaking into the team and helping lift Les Gones from bottom of Ligue 1 to an eventual sixth-place finish and Europa League qualification.

A strong, composed defender with impressive aerial and passing ability, O‚ÄôBrien made 32 appearances for Lyon in all competitions, also showing his qualities in front of goal by finding the back of the net five times, including in the Coupe de France final against Paris Saint-Germain.


He was rewarded with his first Ireland cap against Hungary in June, joining his new Blues teammate Coleman in defence in a 2-1 win.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm buzzing and so happy to have signed for Everton,‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien told evertontv. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been dreaming of this kind of move in the Premier League, with such a historic club. It‚Äôs a very exciting move for me.

‚ÄúEverton is a huge club with a lot of history behind it and there‚Äôs a big future as well.

‚ÄúWhen the transfer window opened there were other clubs in for me but there was only one club I wanted to go to ‚Äì it was Everton.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve shown the faith in me so now it‚Äôs my turn to show why on the pitch.‚Äù


The Blues‚Äô new defender added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a ball-playing centre half, fast, I like to attack in both boxes and I like to bring a bit of excitement.

‚ÄúYou see how Sean Dyche develops young centre-halves and what he has done for Jarrad [Branthwaite]. The way he‚Äôs going now, the season he‚Äôs had in the Premier League, it‚Äôs obviously something"

lfyaeus,NUFC,1ehbrm8,0.5,Geordie Journos video said there was a Japanese fan at one of the events and his favourite players were Albert Luque and Barton. We are definitely bringing over a different class of player for the fans out there to get excited about.

lfmh9m2,NUFC,1eforkb,0.6,"No, I think you got it wrong. That's the famous, **Geordie Groove.** Nineties popband/boyband. Very popular in their day. Smooth Sandro, B-Rythm in the middle and Jazzy Joe."

lgbqliz,NUFC,1ej8ibh,-0.2,"Bruno: I suite this captains band, don't you think."
lgcjtg0,NUFC,1ej8ibh,0.7,"Before his impressive stint of not getting booked I wouldn‚Äôt have picked him as a captain- too emotional and prone to petulance, but he really matured and arguably his game improved as a result of his mentality change. I think he‚Äôd make a good VC or part of the leadership team from the outside."
lgc5brb,NUFC,1ej8ibh,1.0,"Bruno Guimaraes is my favourite Newcastle United player of all time.¬†¬†


¬†When we were at our worst, he jumped on the band wagon and helped steer it to safety.. On the pitch, off the pitch, everything he does, oozes class. His diving header against Leicester in his first season, and his subsequent ""fuck you, imma strip naked!"" celebration, still gives me chills.¬†¬†


¬†He believed when few did and I fucking I love this man."

lgbykv3,NUFC,1ej8ibh,0.2,I'm wondering if there's more to this. Would this post be happening if it was just for a friendly or is Trippier definitely on the move?
